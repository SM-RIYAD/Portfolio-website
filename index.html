    <h3>World class WEB developer</h3>
    <p>
        I am a web developer. I spend my whole day, practically every day, experimenting with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,and more;  and inhaling a wide variety of potentially useless information through a few hundred RSS feeds. I build websites that delight and inform. I do it well.
        I am curious, and I enjoy work that challenges me to learn something new and stretch in a different direction. I do my best to stay on top of changes in the state of the art so that I can meet challenges with tools well suited to the job at hand. The list of projects I follow on GitHub will give you a good idea of the types of tools I'd prefer to be using.
